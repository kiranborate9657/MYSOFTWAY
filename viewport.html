    <p>
        The initial viewport refers to the window or viewing area of the UA before user agent styles, HTML <meta> tags, or CSS styles have overridden its size. The initial viewport size is based on the size of the window or viewing area, and not the content. The size of a full-screen user agent's initial viewport will differ between orientations and devices, but will always be the same for the same device in the same orientation.
